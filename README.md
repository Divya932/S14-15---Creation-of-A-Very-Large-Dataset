# S14-15: Creation of A Very Large Dataset

This Repo explains how you can, not just use available datasets in your journey of DNN but efficiently create them yourself.

## Description  
We have used approximately 100 background images and 100 foreground objects to create a massive dataset with more than 400,000 images.  
Also, corresponding masks for each resultant as well as foreground objects has been created.  
We ultimately create depth maps of all images in our dataset.  
A special focus has been laid on to handling such massive size of data efficiently with limited resources.
